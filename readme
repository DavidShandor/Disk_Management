Program Description:
This Program is a simulation of Disk Management using Unix-fs system.
The system works with 3 direct access blocks and 1 single InDirect block that could contain more size_block Indirect blocks
Each block contain file data. For big file we can extand the size using the single blocks.

Commands number and explaination:
0 - Delete fsDisk with all the data, and exit the program.
1 - Print disk contents and files list.
2 - Format the disk, required block size and number of direct blocks.
3 - Create new file. Cannot Create file with name that already exist. Also,     Cannot Create file if there is no atleast 1 block to be allocate.
4 - Open file. Works only if the file has been create before.
5 - Close file. 
6 - Write new data to file.
7 - Read Len chars from file (if len > file size then read all the file only).

How to use the program:
First, format the disk using the command "2", then choose block size and number of direct blocks.
Open a new file, by use command "3", and give it a name. 
Write data into the open file, using command "6" and by FD (the file Descriptor). 
Close (5), open (4) or delete (8) file by the required command. 



NOTE:
The Program work only if disk has been formatted.
Max Disk Size is 256, and Max blocks on the system is 256/block_size.
Max file number of block is: direct blocks + block_size (as Single).
Max file size is : (direct blocks + block_size) * block_size;

Importent! Some commands required FD (Integer) and others required File name (a String).
Please make sure to provide the appropriate requirement.
